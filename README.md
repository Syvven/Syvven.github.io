# Point And Augh

## Description

Point and Augh is a silly little project that I made to learn javascript and sprite animation. I never meant for it to go beyond just a little bit of flair but then my sister (biologist studying flies and worms) and my girlfriend (graphic design major) got involved and it only evolved from there. Its a simple point and click game that tracks score. 

The game works best on desktop/laptop but does work on mobile. I had difficulties getting the display right on mobile and sometimes it just straight up doesn't work, but I didn't want to get hung up on the platform it wasn't meant for--maybe I'll make an app version sometime.

It is by no means perfect, nor is it even close, but its a first attempt and I will likely refactor it in the future, in addition to adding more features.

## DISCLAIMER

This game contains very loud sound clips. I very much recommend turning your volume down if you don't want to go deaf, however, it is much funnier to have the volume loud :)

## How To Play

To start the game, go to [this website](https://syvven.github.io).

The game is very simple: 
- Flies fly across the screen moving horizontally and vertically
- Click on the fly to splat it against the wall
- Each fly splatted plays a meme sound clip to spice up the game a bit
  - WARNING: Some of the sound clips can be very loud
- If a fly reaches the leftmost edge of the screen, the game ends and displays your score
- The "Reset" button in the top right can be clicked to reset the game at any point
- A speed slider at the top controls the speed of the flies from 0x to 3x

## Future Additions

- More robust menu / less obstructive text
- Tutorial
- More enemies / special enemies
- More sounds
- Better support for mobile, likely in form of app

# Point And Augh

## Description

Point and Augh is a silly little project that I made to learn javascript and sprite animation. I never meant for it to go beyond just a little bit of flair but then my sister (biologist studying flies and worms) got involved and it only evolved from there. Its a simple point and click game that tracks score. 

The game works best on desktop/laptop but does work on mobile. I had difficulties getting the display right on mobile and sometimes it just straight up doesn't work, but I didn't want to get hung up on the platform it wasn't meant for--maybe I'll make an app version sometime.
